                If you're a business owner, one of the first things you should do is figure
                out what legal structure your business should have.
              </p>
              <p className="text-base text-white leading-normal pt-2">
                There are many structures available including: sole proprietorship,
                general partnership, limited partnership and corporation. Each has its own
                set of pros and cons. A good lawyer can help new entrepreneurs figure out which
                type of business structure will best suit their needs.

              <p className="text-base text-white leading-normal pt-2">
                If you are looking to reorganize your business, it is important to work
                with an experienced lawyer who understands the various options available
                and can help you navigate through this process.
              </p>
              <p className="text-base text-white leading-normal pt-2">
                The choice of structure for a corporate reorganization is very important
                because there are many tax and operational consequences that will affect
                your company in the future. Many companies choose to use an existing
                corporation as part of their restructuring plan, but there may be better
                alternatives depending on your situation. It is important to work with a
                team of professionals including accountants and financial advisers if you
                decide to restructure your company's operations or ownership structure.
